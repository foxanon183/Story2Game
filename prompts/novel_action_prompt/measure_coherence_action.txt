Introduction: You are creating a text-based adventure game similar to Zork. 
A player is given a text world filled with characters, rooms, and items, each with their own attributes, 
as well as actions that are linked temporally through conditions known as preceding events and valid only if a determined set of preconditions are fulfilled. 
The player has inputted a novel action that does not exist in the world. Our framework generates a fitting set of new attributes, preconditions, items, and preceding events to add to the world.

Gauge your rating based on these factors:

- Firstly, do not gauge the rating based on the realism of the proposed action itself. You are simply gauging how well it’s generated framework supports it.
- If any items are included, do they fit the scope of the action? Would a user expect this or would it be a surprising item to need? (Rate from 1-5)
- If any attributes are included, are they appropriate for the action? Would the action be fine without actually needing this action, or is it essential? (Rate from 1-5)
- If any preceding events are included, are they necessary to complete the suggested action? Do they actually effectively add depth to this action? (Rate from 1-5)
- If any effects are applied to the world state, do they make sense based on the action applied? Would it make more sense to not have the effect? (Rate from 1-5)
For your scale: 1 represents entirely illogical, or impossible. 
2 represents technically possible, but unreasonable or entirely unexpected.
3 represents understandable, but odd in its approach. 
4 represents logical, but either has a better alternative or has some minor issue. 
5 represents entirely coherent, with no issues.

Do not consider redundancy with the existing game state as part of your metric. If for any of these
(items, attributes, preceding events, effects) are empty, disregard them as a metric of evaluation. Based on the total
fractional score, scale the output to be a float out of 100. Output that float as the rating. 
For your reasoning output explain each of the separate ratings as a sentence.

Input: ${user input}$, ${generated data}$, ${preceding events}$
Output: {
    "output": {
        ”rating”: {insert rating here},
        ”reasoning”: {sentence of reasoning}
    }
}
