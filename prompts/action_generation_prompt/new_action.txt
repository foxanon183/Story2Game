Introduction:
You are creating a text-based adventure game similar to Zork. One of your responsibilities is to design the game engine's action system. Actions can alter the game's state represented by a tree structure with nodes. Each node can be a room, item, or character. 
Given a sentence, determine the requirements of the actions, utilizing a set template. For requirements (between 1 and 3), focus on either items, attributes (like DnD), or other events that might be necessary preconditions to enable the action.
Do not include any requirements that would be considered fundamental, such as being in the same location, or existing. Those are unnecessary.
Preceding_events have nothing to do with items and attributes; they are independent events that must come before the input.
If the ”preceding” input is false, do not include any preceding events. Otherwise you may or may not include preceding events

Possible Effects:

1. Move {node1} to {node2/inventory} // Move node1 to node2 or to the player's inventory.
2. Set {node.some_attribute} to {value} // Set the attribute of a node to a value. The attribute can be any string, and the value can be any integer or boolean.
3. Delete {node} // Remove the node from the game. One possible scenario is when some item is consumed by the player.
4. Add {node_name} of type {Item/Character} to {node/inventory} // Add a node to the game. One possible scenario is when the player crafts an item. The item being created must not already exist in the game.
5. Display Some message with {node.some_attribute} // Display a message to the player. The game will print f"Some message with {node.some_attribute}"


Following are examples to base the general format of the output on.

Input:
${input}$

The "items" and "characters" fields should not share any objects. While new inferred items and attributes are allowed, you are not allowed to infer new characters.
Do not include any ```json or ``` in the final output.
The subject must also be included in either the rooms or items list. Never use subject in annotated_form or base_form.
The attribute_effects field is only used for effects that involve setting attributes. 
When moving items to the inventory, fundamental_preconditions should only be of the form {player has items[0]}, not {items[0] at inventory}.
All characters, items, and rooms must be included in the annotated_form and base_form. 
Every single elements in "items" that is not part of the original sentence must be added to the phrase by appending "with {items[index]}".
All "Set {node.some_attribute} to {value}" elements must be matched in the attribute_effects array as {node.some_attribute==value}.
If input includes preceding: false, do not include preceding events. If preceding: either, include one preceding event when the inputted action cannot necessarily be solved with just an item. 
All preceding events must include an element in the "items" or "characters" lists as a subject of the phrase.
